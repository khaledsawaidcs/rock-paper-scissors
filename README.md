# Rock Paper Scissors Game

I created this small project in order to start working on my 
python skills while using Git and GitHub by using the terminal
and using the GitHub website. 

This rock paper scissors game will have 2 options:
1. player vs player
2. computer vs player

For now, I won't have any users, the players will remain anonymous
and without some king of score tracking.

After I finish the basics, I'll try to users with databases to make this
a little bit more close to real world applications.
